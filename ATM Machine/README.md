# ATM Simulation Program
This project simulates a basic ATM machine that allows users to check their balance, withdraw money, deposit money, and exit the system.

# Features
Check Balance: View the current balance.
Withdraw Money: Withdraw a specified amount from the balance.
Deposit Money: Deposit a specified amount into the balance.
Exit: Exit the ATM system.

# Functionality

When the script is run, the following steps occur:

The user is prompted to insert their debit card (simulated with a delay).
The user is prompted to enter their PIN.
If the PIN is correct, the user can choose from the following options:
Check Balance
Withdraw Money
Deposit Money
Exit
The user selects an option by entering the corresponding number.
The selected operation is performed, and the user is prompted with the menu again.
If the user selects "Exit", the program ends with a goodbye message.
If the PIN is incorrect, an error message is displayed, and the program ends.
