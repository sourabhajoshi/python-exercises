Scenario: Online Shopping System
Imagine you are developing a basic Online Shopping System for an e-commerce platform. The system should allow users to:

Browse and view different products.
Add products to their shopping cart.
Check out and view the total price of the items in the cart.
Apply discounts or promotions to their order.
We will have several key components:

Product: Represents an individual item in the store.
ShoppingCart: A collection of products the user is planning to buy.
Order: Represents a completed order, which includes the items in the cart and the total cost.
Discount: Represents a discount that can be applied to the order.
